Use Case Diagram contains four elements:
  -Systems
  -Actors
  -Use Cases
  -Relationships

Systems: whatever you're developing (website, app, software component etc..)
  -anything within the app square, happens in the app (system)
  -outside the square, doesn't happen in the app

Actor: someone or something that uses the system (person, org, another system etc..)

Use Case: describes what the system does (features actions)
  -use case description should start with a verb (log, check, transter, make etc..)

Relationships: connects the relationships between the Actor and Use Case or Use case and another Use Case
  -association
  -include: base case can't run without include case. ex: when the base case excutes, excute the include as well. base --<<include>>--> include
  -extend: similar to include but it doesn't happen everytime a base case excutes. only happen when a certain event occurs. base <--<<extend>>-- extend
  -generalization: children connected to the parent ex. parent(log in) child(success) child(fail)
